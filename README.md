# Kali Linux Dotfiles

My personal Kali Linux dotfiles.

Current version: `2020.3`

## Set up

The set up is fairly similar to [my normal dotfiles](https://github.com/qxxxb/dotfiles).

### Root account

Copy `zsh` and `neovim` dotfiles to `/root` so we can have a decent setup in the root shell with `sudo -s` as well.
